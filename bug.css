The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common error when using the `calc()` function: 

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```

The problem arises when there is a space between the operator and the numeric value within the `calc()` function.  In many cases this leads to the calculation failing and the width not being applied correctly. 

Incorrect: `calc(100% - 10px)`
Correct: `calc(100% - 10px)`
